# DCGAN
Our aim is to blend human artistry with AI innovation by creating images born from collaboration between artists and artificial intelligence. Our objective is to curate a unique collection of images that embody the fusion of human creativity and machine-generated art.

We couldn't find the right datasets, so we collected our own data to get the results we needed. We gathered 12,206 human-made art images and 8,334 AI-generated images to use in our project
